# Automated Assessment Student answers using LLMs and Prompt Engineering

This project aims to develop a web-based system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and prompt engineering to automatically assess student answers based on pre-defined
rubrics provided by teachers.

The system will streamline the assessment process, reduce
marking workload, and provide faster feedback to students.
